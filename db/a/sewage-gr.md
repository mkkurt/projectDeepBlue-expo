P8R1: Damaged hose or pipe.
P8S1: Repair or replace.
P8R2: Air distributor clogged or damaged.
P8S2: Clean or replace the air distributor.

Problem
P9: There is an odor coming from the system.

Possible Problem and Solution
P9R1: Too much mineral sludge in the aeration tank.
P9S1: Check the sludge content in the tank and drain if necessary.
P9R2: Bacteria are dead. (Brown sludge indicates normal bacterial life, while black sludge indicates that the bacteria are dead.)
P9S2: Check the function of the air fan by opening the tank lids, foam or bubbles should be seen on the surface while the fan is running. Empty the tank and wash it with clean water.

Problem
P10: The discharged water is dirty.

Possible Reasons and Solutions
P10R1: The amount of wastewater entering the system is too high, which creates too much hydraulic load.
P10S1: Nothing can be done.
P10R2: The system has just been started, bacteria have not yet formed.
P10S2: Check the start-up time, it takes about three to four weeks for bacteria to form when the system is first started.
P10R3: Bacteria are dead.
P10S3: See "There is an odor coming from the system".

Problem
P11: There is too much dirt on the surface of the settling tank.

Possible Reasons and Solutions
P11R1: In large systems, the foam trap may not be working properly or sufficiently.
P11S1: Check and adjust the water level valve in the foam trap (e.g., about 40 mm below the water level).

Problem
P12: Too much black sludge on the surface of the settling tank.

Possible Reasons and Solutions
P12R1: Insufficient operation of the sludge return pump.
P12S1.1: Check and adjust the sludge return valve.
P12S1.2: Check the air hose connected to the sludge return pipe.
P12S1.3: Drain the sludge in the compartment.

Problem
P13: There is no chlorine in the discharged water.

Possible Reasons and Solutions
P13R1: Dosing pump or system is not working.
P13S1: Check the functions of the pump or system.
P13R2: Disinfectant (chlorine) tank is empty.
P13S2: Fill the tank.
P13R3: Dosage rate is too low.
P13S3: Increase the rate by adjusting the dosing pump.
P13R4: Chlorine has lost its effect.
P13S4: Empty the chlorine tank and prepare a new solution.

6.5.2 SYSTEM WHERE TOILET WASTE IS SUCKED INTO THE TANK BY VACUUM

All problems and possible solutions in the system where toilet waste enters the unit by gravity are also valid for the system where toilet waste is sucked by vacuum. However, since there are ejector pumps and ejectors in the systems where toilet waste is sucked by vacuum, in addition to the normal system, some problems may occur outside the normal system. Therefore, the problems related to the system in question are stated.

Problem
P1: Vacuum cannot be provided even though the ejector pump is running.

Possible Reasons and Solutions:
P1R1: The tank is empty or there is foam instead of liquid in the tank.
P1S1.1: Fill the tank with water at least to the lower float switch level and check the pump performance.
P1S1.2: Excessive vibration will occur when the pump tries to pump foam instead of liquid. In this case, add water to the tank and try again. If the problem is not solved despite adding water to the tank, reduce the amount of foam by pouring anti-foam chemical into the tank.

P1R2: Clogged or damaged ejector.
P1S2: Maintain the ejector.

P1R3: Valves are closed.
P1S3: Check and open the valves, if there is blockage in the valves, maintain them.

P1R4: Wrong rotation direction of the motor.
P1S4: Change the motor connections (phases).

P1R5: Blockage or leakage in the pump circuit.
P1S5: Close the pump inlet valve and run the pump, if there is a vacuum in the pump, there is a leak in the circuit before the valve, find and fix the leak.

Problem

P2: Ejector pump cannot provide sufficient vacuum.

Possible Reasons and Solutions

P2R1: Blockage in the ejector due to waste.
P2S1.1: Make sure the pump is stopped and the valve is closed.
P2S1.2: Clean the waste in the ejector and the ejector, if no results are obtained, apply the following procedures:
Remove the flange connections, elbows, connection cone and ejector.
Remove the non-return valve in front of (inlet of) the ejector.
Clean the sealing surfaces and replace the valve if necessary.
While the ejector is disassembled, check the inside of the nozzle and the ejector housing for sludge and dirt.
Assemble the ejector and non-return valve by reversing the disassembly order.
Check all sealing elements and renew if necessary.
Check that the non-return valve is assembled correctly and connected in the correct direction.
