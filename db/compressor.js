// The performance of the air compressor should be measured when new or immediately after overhaul to determine how long it takes a serviced compressor to fill the air cylinder between certain pressure values. However, this performance measurement should be done at a time when the air is normally used or at night. For example, if the compressor, which operates between 24-29 bar with previously taken values and fills the cylinder in 5 minutes, increases this time when subjected to performance measurement under the same conditions, the reason should be investigated. However, attention should also be paid to the frequency of activation of the air compressor. For example, the compressor, which is operated continuously, will stop when the pressure in the air cylinder reaches 29 bar. The time between this stop and the automatic restart must be recorded. If this time is, for example, 50 minutes at the beginning and then 60 minutes after a while when the pressure in the air cylinder drops to 24 bar and there is an increase in the time the compressor is on, then problems with the compressor should be investigated.
