# Setup Summary - Running on iPhone Without Computer

## What Was Changed

This repository has been configured to support running the app on your iPhone without needing your computer, using Expo's cloud build service (EAS Build).

### Files Modified

1. **package.json** - Added `expo-dev-client` package (v6.0.15)
   - This package enables custom development builds that work like Expo Go but support custom native code

2. **app.json** - Added `expo-dev-client` plugin
   - Configured the app to use the development client

3. **eas.json** - Enhanced build configuration
   - Added proper iOS build settings
   - Configured three build profiles: development, preview, and production
   - Added update channels for over-the-air updates
   - Set resource class for faster builds

### Files Created

1. **.github/workflows/eas-build.yml** - Automated build workflow
   - Triggers on push to main branch or manual dispatch
   - Builds the app for iOS/Android using EAS Build
   - Supports development, preview, and production profiles

2. **.github/workflows/eas-update.yml** - Automated update workflow
   - Triggers when code changes are pushed
   - Publishes over-the-air updates to installed apps
   - No rebuild required for JavaScript/React changes

3. **IPHONE_SETUP.md** - Detailed user guide
   - Step-by-step instructions for first-time setup
   - How to install on iPhone
   - Troubleshooting tips

4. **SETUP_SUMMARY.md** - This file

## How It Works

### Traditional Expo Go (Limitations)
- ❌ Cannot run apps with custom native dependencies
- ❌ Limited to basic Expo SDK features
- ❌ Not suitable for production apps

### New Setup with EAS Build + Dev Client (What We Have Now)
- ✅ Supports all native dependencies
- ✅ Works exactly like your own custom app
- ✅ Over-the-air updates for JavaScript changes
- ✅ No computer needed after initial setup
- ✅ Install directly on iPhone via browser/email

## The Process

### One-Time Setup (What You Need to Do)
1. Get Expo access token from expo.dev
2. Add it to GitHub repository secrets as `EXPO_TOKEN`
3. Trigger first build via GitHub Actions
4. Install on iPhone from email/Expo dashboard (~15-30 minutes wait)

### Daily Development (Automatic)
1. Make code changes
2. Commit and push to GitHub
3. Updates automatically published
4. Reopen app on iPhone to receive updates

## Next Steps

Follow the instructions in **IPHONE_SETUP.md** to:
1. Set up your Expo token
2. Trigger your first build
3. Install on your iPhone

## Technical Details

- **Expo SDK**: 51.0.0
- **Build System**: EAS Build (Expo Application Services)
- **Update System**: EAS Update
- **Development Client**: expo-dev-client v6.0.15
